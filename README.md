Belatrix Code Review

1. Feedback to original source code: 
1.1. Private variables should follow the same naming convention, for example the variable LogToDatabase should be named _logToDatabase.
1.2. Private variable _initialized is not used and should be removed from code.
1.3. SOLID principles are needed and used on source code rewriting, for instance the Single Responsibility principle.
1.4. CleanCode principles are needed and used on source code rewriting.
1.5. C# 6 features, for example string interpolation feature are used on source code rewriting.
